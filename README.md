# HERE-traffic-speed-data-exploration

INRIX is a private company headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. It provides location-based data such as traffic and parking. Here Technologies (trading as Here) is a Netherlands-based company that provides mapping and location data and related services to individuals and companies. The project utilized historical speed data from both INRIX and HERE for congestion prediction, data evaluation and robustness check.

TMC segments are further classified into different levels based on their speed and volume by both INRIX and HERE. The locations of the TMC with data coverage is shown below. It is worth noting that neither INRIX and HERE provides speed data on low order roads such as private streets, neighborhood roads, etc.
